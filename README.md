# Accident Detector using Arduino

This project is an **Accident Detection System** built with Arduino.  
It detects sudden impacts or crashes using sensors and can trigger an alert mechanism.

## 🚗 Features
- Detects sudden impacts or accidents using vibration or tilt sensors.
- Can be integrated with a GSM module to send an SMS alert.
- Easy to customize for other safety projects.

## 📂 Files
- `accident_detector.ino` — Main Arduino code.

## 🛠️ Hardware Required
- Arduino UNO/Nano
- Vibration sensor or tilt sensor
- GSM module (optional)
- Buzzer or LED for alert (optional)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## 📌 How to Use
1. Connect the sensors and modules as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the `accident_detector.ino` code to your Arduino board.
3. Test by simulating an impact to check if the system triggers an alert.
